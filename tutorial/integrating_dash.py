    # Integrating Dash with Existing Web Apps

    This section describes three different approaches to embedding a Dash app
    within an existing web application.

    ## Using an `<iframe>`

    The simplest approach to embedding Dash in an existing web application is to
    include an `<iframe>` element in your HTML whose `src` attribute points
    towards the address of a deployed Dash app. This allows you to place your
    Dash app in a specific location within an existing web page with your
    desired dimensions:""")),

    ## Embedding a Dash app within an Existing Flask App

    As discussed in the [Deployment Chapter](/deployment), Dash uses the Flask
    web framework under the hood. This makes it fairly straightforward to
    embed a Dash app at a specific route of an existing Flask app.

    In the following example, a Dash app is mounted at the `/dash` route (eg
    `http://localhost:8050/dash`) of a Flask app:

    app = dash.Dash(
        __name__,
        server=server,
        routes_pathname_prefix='/dash/'
    )

    app.layout = html.Div("My Dash app")

    ## Combining One or More Dash Apps with Existing WSGI Apps

    This approach uses Werkzeug's
    [`DispatcherMiddleware`](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/latest/middlewares/)
    to combine one or more Dash apps with existing WSGI apps (including
    Flask). It is useful when you want to combine multiple Dash apps or when
    your existing app is a non-Flask WSGI app.

    with a Flask app.

    `DispatcherMiddleware` routes requests to based on the prefix of the
    incoming requests. Within each Dash app, `requests_pathname_prefix` must be
    specified as the app's mount point, in order to match the route prefix
    set by the `DispatcherMiddleware`.
